To ensure that a progam  is function and secure its important to run test software to make sure it functions correctly. Of course this means that youll also have to write funtional test software but this is an important step and why its useful to have a seperate team or person run testing on software, it can help avoid bias. Its also important to make sure you are checking your software sooner rather than later. The longer you wait to test software the more will have to change taking more time if something goes wrong.
To incorporate users need you should sit down and ask them for all the features they want. You should make a list marking out the most important or core parts of the program and create a map that can be worked on for feature sets for the program. 
How I approach designing software is looking at the first that that needs to be done and working from there. If a progam has a log in screen, thats what the user will see first so you can start there. As you move along the program we be built up more and more until you have the end product.
